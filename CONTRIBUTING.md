- **Issues** for bug reports, improvement proposals, or questions
- **Discussions** for ideas, feedback, and broader proposals
- **Pull Requests** for documentation and community-related changes

Please use **English** for all interactions.

## Types of contributions

During the bootstrap phase, you can contribute by:

- Opening issues to share ideas or feedback
- Participating in discussions about project direction and governance
- Improving documentation and community resources
