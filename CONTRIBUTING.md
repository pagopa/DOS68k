# Contributing to DOS68k

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DOS68k.

At this stage, the project is in an early bootstrap phase.
Community participation is welcome and encouraged, even before
the introduction of production-ready code.

## Where collaboration happens

All project interactions take place on GitHub:

- **Issues** for bug reports, improvement proposals, or questions
- **Discussions** for ideas, feedback, and broader proposals
- **Pull Requests** for bug reports, improvement proposal 

Please use **English** for all interactions.

## Types of contributions

DOS68k is expected to welcome different types of contributions, including:

- Opening issues to report bugs, suggest improvements, or share feedback
- Participating in discussions about project direction, architecture, and governance
- Improving documentation and community resources
- Contributing code, such as bug fixes, new features, refactoring, or tests
- Reviewing pull requests and providing technical feedback

Some contribution types (especially code-related ones) will become fully
available as the project codebase and technical workflows are introduced.

## Commit messages (recommended)

During the bootstrap phase, commit messages should be clear and descriptive.

When applicable, we recommend using a scope prefix to improve readability
for external contributors, for example:

- `[community] Add draft community guidelines`
- `[governance] Update proposed decision-making process`

This is a **recommendation**, not a requirement, and may evolve as the
project governance matures.

## Pull Requests (early-stage)

Pull Requests are welcome for documentation and community-related changes.

Each Pull Request should:
- Clearly describe what is being changed
- Explain the motivation behind the change
- Be appropriate for an early-stage project

## Governance and decisions

Project governance, roles, and decision-making processes are described in
[GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md).

For significant or cross-cutting proposals, contributors are encouraged
to start with a GitHub Discussion, as outlined in the governance document.

## Code of Conduct

The project's Code of Conduct is described in
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The Code of Conduct will be defined and approved at organizational level.
Until then, this file serves as a placeholder.

This document will be refined and expanded as the project evolves.
