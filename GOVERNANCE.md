# Governance

DOS68k is an open source project intended to support Public Administration
through open and collaborative development.

This document proposes an initial governance model aimed at ensuring
transparency, accountability, and sustainability.

## Roles (proposed)

### Contributors
Anyone who participates by opening issues, contributing documentation,
joining discussions, or submitting pull requests.

### Maintainers
Trusted contributors responsible for reviewing and approving changes.
Maintainers help guide the project and support the community.

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
A small group responsible for strategic direction and for resolving
disputes when consensus cannot be reached.

## Decision-making (proposed)

- Decisions should be discussed openly and transparently
- Consensus is preferred whenever possible
- For significant or controversial changes, the TSC may make a final decision

## Maintainer promotion (proposed)

Promotion to Maintainer is merit-based and considers:
- Consistent and high-quality contributions
- Constructive and respectful behavior
- Alignment with the project’s goals

## Maintainer inactivity or removal (proposed)

A Maintainer may step down voluntarily or become inactive.
Inactivity over an extended period may result in removal of permissions,
with the possibility of reinstatement.

## Evolution of governance

This governance model may evolve as the project matures.
Significant changes should be proposed and discussed publicly.
