# Community Guidelines

DOS68k aims to foster an open, respectful, and collaborative community.

These guidelines describe the expected interaction style within the
project during its early stages.

## Respect and inclusivity

- Treat all participants with respect
- Assume good intentions
- Avoid dismissive or aggressive language

## Constructive collaboration

- Focus on solving problems, not assigning blame
- Provide clear and actionable feedback
- Help others learn and contribute

## Communication

- Use clear titles and provide sufficient context
- Keep discussions focused and on topic
- Be patient: responses may take time, especially early on

## Disagreements

Disagreements are normal in open collaboration.
When they occur:
- Focus on ideas, not individuals
- Explain your reasoning clearly
- Aim for consensus when possible

## Code of Conduct

A formal Code of Conduct will be introduced once approved at
organizational level.
These guidelines complement, but do not replace, that Code of Conduct.

---

These guidelines will evolve together with the community.
